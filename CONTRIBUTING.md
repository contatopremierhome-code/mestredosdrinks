# Contributing to this project

To get your project on GitHub, follow these steps in your terminal, from the root of your project directory:

### 1. Initialize a new Git repository
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add all your project files to the staging area
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Commit the staged files
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. Rename the default branch to `main`
```bash
git branch -M main
```

### 5. Add your GitHub repository as a remote
First, create a new repository on GitHub. Then, copy the repository's URL and run the following command, replacing the placeholder with your URL:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
```

### 6. Push your code to GitHub
This will upload your local repository to the remote one on GitHub.
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

After following these steps, your code will be live on your GitHub repository!
